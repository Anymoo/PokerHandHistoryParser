Poker Hand History Parser
=========================

Introduction
------------

The hand-parser was written to take poker hand-history logs and parse summary information and/or hand-action information. The parser was generally designed to be fast, and in some places this may have affected code read-ability, however there are extensive unit tests.

The poker hand-history parser currently supports the following sites:

 * Poker Stars (.com / .fr / .it)
