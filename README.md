Poker Hand History Parser
=========================

C# .NET library for parsing poker hand-histories.

What can it be user for?
------------------------

Parsing hand-histories is a common task in most 3rd party poker projects, however it has many edge cases, formats and is very tedious. The hand-parser was written to take poker hand-history text logs and parse summary information and/or hand-action information without having to deal with all the headaches. The parser was designed to be fairly fast, and in some places this may have affected code read-ability, however there are extensive unit tests.

Site Support
------------

The poker hand-history parser currently supports the following sites:

 * Poker Stars (.com / .fr / .it)
 * Full Tilt Poker
 * Party Poker
 * On Game (.com / .fr / .it)
